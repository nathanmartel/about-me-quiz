        <h1>Count von Count! Mwah Ha Ha Haaa!</h1>
        <p>The Count debuted on <em>Sesame Street</em> in the premiere of Season 4 (1972–73). His main role is to teach counting skills to children. He loves counting so much that he often will count anything and everything regardless of size or amount, even to the point of annoying other characters.</p>

<h2>The Count is kinda the worst!</h2>
<p>Over the years, he has made numerous <em>Sesame Street</em> characters extremely upset!</p>
<ul>
    <li>He once hired Ernie to answer his telephone so that he wouldn't be bothered while looking for things to count. He then impulsively forbade him from answering the first call that came through until it was way too late, because he wanted to count all 5 times the telephone rang, and a mêlée resulted when the caller re-tried, resulting in an argument with Ernie.</li>
    <li>On his first day of serving as an elevator operator, the Count foolishly neglected to let Kermit the Frog out at his selected floor, because he wanted to count all 10 floors in the building, and was unable to stop until he finished, leaving Kermit very angry.</li>
    <li>The Count tricked Oscar the Grouch into saying the word "no" 17 times, by continuously knocking on his trash can and prodding him to help the Count find something to count 17 of.</li>
</ul>
